# Taxonomic and genetic prediction using codon usage frequencies
Project for the Machine Learning course of "Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics" MSc.

The work involves utilizing codon percentages from various species' genomes to categorize samples into their respective kingdoms. The primary goal was to explore the potential of codon usage frequencies across different organisms in classifying codon usage into 11 distinct Kingdoms: archaea, bacteria, bacteriophage, plasmid, plant, invertebrate, vertebrate, mammal, rodent, primate, and virus.
This analysis encompasses the application and assessment of clustering, classification, and regression techniques acquired throughout the course.
